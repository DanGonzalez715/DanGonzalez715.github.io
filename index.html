<h2>About Me</h2>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>I am a student at Ball State University and I am about to finish my senior year.
I am currently living on Ball State's campus but I plan to move back to Chicago, which is where I'm originally from, once I graduate.
I will be graduateing this spring at the beginning of May with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science.</p>
<br>
<h2>Capstone Project</h2>
<p></p>
<br>
<h3>Betterflye Content Management Group</h3>
<p>We are working with a company named Betterflye to create a content management system.
    The system will be able to filter out innappropriate user-added content from their website.

<h3>Specific parts of the project that I have worked on</h3>
<p>My personal contributions to the project include helping to work on the filter itself.
    When a user tries to make a post that includes profane language then the filter makes sure that the post is blocked and that an admin is notified about the blocked post. 
    I also worked on a feature that allows users to send an appeal to website admins if their posts get blocked.
    when a users post gets blocked by the filter only the user that made the post and the website admins are able to see the post.
    The user that made the post that got blocked is able to send an appeal and explain to the website admins why they believe their post should not be blocked.
    The website admin recives this appeal message and can decide whether to allow the post or not.
    Another feauture I contributed to is the ability for an organization admin to be able to ban a user from their organization if they are causing problems.
    If an admin of an organization feels that a member is causing problems they have the ability to manage the users that are a part of the organization.
    In the users tab there is a button that says ban user and when clicked they will be able to type the username of the user that is causing problems and ban them.
    Additionally there are lists of users that fall under organization admins, organization supporters and organization members.
    Clicking the x that is next to each of the users names on one of the lists will allow you to ban the user as well.
    The user that is banned is no longer able to access the organization page and is redirected to a page that say they no longer have access to the page.
