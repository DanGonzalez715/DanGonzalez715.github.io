<p><strong>Specific parts of the project that I have worked on</strong></p>
<p>My personal contributions to the project include helping to work on the filter itself.
    I also worked on a feature that allows users to send an appeal to admins if their posts get blocked or flagged.
    Another feauture I contributed to is the ability for an organization admion to be able to ban a user from their organization if they are causing problems.
